Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Sanchit Monga

================================================================
process_word
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:Follow the given instructions and then use the functions from the project part 1 and perform the operations
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:Used the functions from the previous part and processed the word
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
get_first_word
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan: TO understand the structure of the p_list function and then returning the word_entry struct at the front of the list
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations: Had to visit the previous function because of which I could not pass all the tests in this function. Although I passed all the tests in previous function alone but there was a problem in the implementation because of  which I could not pass all the tests in the get_first_word function.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
get_next_word
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan: To understand and follow the same procedure as the previous function and then try to complete the given task.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations: Returned the current pointer value in the list and then moved the pointer forward. As I am moving forward I think it is becoming more and more easy.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
get_last_word
Start
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:TO follow the instructions and implement the given function and pass all the tests
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:Was same as the get first word and used the same implemementation strategy.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
get_prev_word
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:To follow the instructions and implement the code by using the reference as the get_next_word
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	03 00
Observations:Had to fix get_next_word which was causing problems in this function and took me a lot of time to understand what was going on in the test functions and then tried interpreting them and then I was able to solve the problems.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
read_file through test 56
Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan: To follow the instructions and then try passing all the tests.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	40 00
Observations: I was stuck on this function for a while and could not complete it. I thought that the problem was in the read_file function. Then i went back to previous functions and I revised them. I could not figure out the problem for days. But finally I found that the problem was in the create_node function of the part1. I was not assigning memory to the unique_word while creating a new_node.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
read_file MLK_dream_excerpt only
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:To follow the instructions and then read the given file.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	05 00
Observations:It took me a lot of time to figure out because my linked_list part1 of the project was not working properly and I could not figure out. But at last I made changes to the program and it worked.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
write_unique_word_list_to_csv_file
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:Follow the instructions, use other helper functions and then write into the file.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:Added and wrote all the words to the file.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Add four unit tests to the unit_tests_student.c file
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:To follow the instrucitons and then go through the given sample tests to get an idea.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Observations: Was able to implement the test functions as it was made easy by the already given test functions.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
