SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Sanchit Monga

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:Follow the instructions and use the properties of the structs
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 20
Observations:Had problems in the loops but fixed almost all of them. Had problem in understanding the question and what we were required to do. It was not clearly mentioned about the csv line structure and the array contained in the csv_line structure
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)



================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	00 40
Plan:Again same, follow the instructions and then compare the outputs.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	00 20
Observations:Still cannot figure out the problem, as there is still one test case that is not passing.
