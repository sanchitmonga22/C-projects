Start
Estimated Time	07 00
Plan:Understand the pointers and go through the slides. Implement and test functions one by one.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	14 00
Observations: Was stuck on filter_any_ptr for 8 hours. Took almost double the time than expected. I tried doing the function in many ways but in the end it worked out. The last two funcitons were the most difficult. To implement the filter_substr function I had to go through the code of last assignment (Find.c) and used the code of find_substr to count the number of substring and assign the malloc size according to that. This assignment was the most challenging assignment till date.  
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
